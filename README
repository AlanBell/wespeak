A web application that you click (or touch) to say words.
You can try it out at http://people.ubuntu.com/~alanbell/speak.html
This uses OpenMary and is currently hard coded to my server http://mumble.libertus.co.uk:59125/ which you can have a play with.
It includes fancybox at the moment but that may be dropped for licensing problems (does not appear to be GPL3 compatible)
The core of the application will be GPL3 licensed.

Currently it links to icons on wikimedia commons, they should be pulled into the repo probably.
